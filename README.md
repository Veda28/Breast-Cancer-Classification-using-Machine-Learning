# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a Machine Learning model to detect the cancerous nodules .Generally , benign nodules are less cancerous and cannot spread in other parts of body while malignant nodules have high chance of being cancerous and can spread it to other parts of body. In this the machine learning model is established, trained, and validated using data set. Model evaluation showed that the model is able to detect the cancerous nodules with 92.98% accuracy.
