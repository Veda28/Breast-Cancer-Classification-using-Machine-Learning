# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a Logistic Regression model to detect the cancerous nodules.Generally , benign nodules are less cancerous and cannot spread in other parts of body while malignant nodules have high chance of being cancerous and can spread it to other parts of body. In this the logistic regression model is established, trained, and validated using data set. Model evaluation showed that the model is able to detect the cancerous nodules with 92.98% accuracy.

Logistic Regression is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm to classify data given. The algorithm can be classified into two types: Binary classification and Multi-class classification.
